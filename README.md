## Project Description
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

## Project Usage
- Double click on index.html (HyperText Markup Language) which is located inside the Landing Page folder.
- Your default browser will open with the Landing Page Project.
- Click on the desired section numbers from the navigation bar and it will scroll you to the desired section.

## Project Dependencies
